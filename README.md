## Project Overview
Welcome to the "User Churn Prediction" project repository, a collaborative effort between Waze and its data team. In this project, we aim to prevent user churn on the Waze app by developing a churn prediction model. Churn quantifies the number of users who have uninstalled the Waze app or stopped using it. Our focus is on monthly user churn, which is a critical metric for user satisfaction and business growth.

Our objectives include:
- Building a churn dataset
- Conducting data analysis
- Developing a churn prediction model
- Identifying factors contributing to churn
- Providing insights to optimize user retention strategies

By accurately predicting user churn, we can proactively engage high-risk users and enhance their experience, ultimately leading to better user retention and business growth.
